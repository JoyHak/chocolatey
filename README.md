### Chocolatey
[Chocolatey is package manager](https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/why/) that helps maintain installed, upgraded, or removed software on Windows. It automates all the mundane getting and installing software work for you. You just select what you want installed and within a few minutes, Chocolatey has downloaded and installed (or upgraded) that software without need for further input from you. It also ensures the security of the installed software through a system of checks and human moderation.

I help ensure the security of my projects using a set of specific signatures. For more information on how to verify the authenticity of a package, see the `verification.txt` file in the "tools" folder for each project here.

### Packages
This repository contains [Chocolatey](https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/why/) packages by @JoyHak, most of which are [automatically](https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/create/automatic-packages) updated. Contributions that can improve packages are welcome. Errors and bugs in the software itself may only be opened and discussed in the repository of the corresponding project.

All packages in this repository are expected to be installable with any version of Chocolatey CLI being made available in the past 12 months, unless a dependency on Chocolatey CLI has been added.
